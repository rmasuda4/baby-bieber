/*
  NOTE: Problem with searching for the word "yeah":
  When searching for whole words in text with punctuation, a naÃ¯ve substring
  search would incorrectly match partial words like "yeahman" or miss words
  like "yeah!" or "yeah?". To solve this, we must:
  1. Split text into individual words (by spaces)
  2. Remove punctuation from each word before comparison
  3. Match only the exact word "yeah" (case-insensitive)

  This ensures we count "Yeah," "yeah!" and "yeah?" as matches, but exclude
  "yeahman", "Yeahyeah", and other words containing "yeah" as a substring.

// Some test invocations:
console.log('hasYeah(bieberBaby) =>', hasYeah(bieberBaby)); // should print true
console.log('hasYeah(bieberBaby.slice(0, 4)) =>', hasYeah(bieberBaby.slice(0, 4))); // might be false
console.log('numYeahs(bieberBaby) =>', numYeahs(bieberBaby)); // expected count based on lyrics
console.log('numYeahs(bieberBaby.slice(2,4)) =>', numYeahs(bieberBaby.slice(2, 4)));

// Additional tests to verify no false positives for substring cases
console.log('hasYeah(["Yeahman is cool"]) =>', hasYeah(['Yeahman is cool'])); // false
console.log('numYeahs(["Yeahman said yeah"] ) =>', numYeahs(['Yeahman said yeah'])); // 1
console.log('numYeahs(["Yeah, yeah! yeah?"]) =>', numYeahs(['Yeah, yeah! yeah?'])); // should be 3
